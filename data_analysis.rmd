## R Markdown
The square root of 3 is `r sqrt(3)`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
height <- c(72,71,66,76,70,71)
ave_height <- mean(height)
sd_height <- sd(height)
```

We measured the heights of `r length(height)` individauls. Their average height wa `r ave_height` (sd =`r sd_height`).

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a *document* will be generated that includes both content as well as the ***output*** of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
